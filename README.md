## How the Web works

### What is the internet?

### What happens when a user types a url and press enter in the browser?

-   You type a URL in your browser and press Enter
-   Browser looks up IP address for the domain
-   Browser initiates TCP connection with the server
-   Browser sends the HTTP request to the server
-   Server processes request and sends back a response
-   Browser renders the content

### What is HTTP?

HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack.
